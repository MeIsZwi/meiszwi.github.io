                    <h2>I saw BIGFOOT!!!</h2>
                    <h5>MeIsZwi - 2/5/25</h5>
                    One day when I was walking home from my schooling, eating a bag of sunflower seeds, I saw it! A large silhouette was walking across the path. I stopped in my tracks and said, “What is that thing, and what is it doing here?”
<br><br>
Then, the bigfoot looked straight at me and said “Excuse me? My pronouns are they/them/he/him!”
<br><br>
I walked up to him and said, “I’m sorry dude. It’s just, you know, you’re bigfoot.”
<br><br>
“Yeah… I get that a lot. It’s ok,” he said. We both decided to go to an arcade. We both ate pizza and played games. It was a fun day. Afterwards, he went back to the forest. I used to be a skeptic because I didn’t trust other people’s accounts, but now, I’m a full believer.
<br><br>
So… uhh… by for now!
