I stopped in my tracks and said, “What is that thing, and what is it doing here?”\n\nThen, the bigfoot looked straight at me and said “Excuse me? My pronouns are they/them/he/him!”\n\nI walked up to him and said, “I’m sorry dude. It’s just, you know, you’re bigfoot.”\n\n“Yeah… I get that a lot. It’s ok,” he said. We both decided to go to an arcade. We both ate pizza and played games. It was a fun day. Afterwards, he went back to the forest. I used to be a skeptic because I didn’t trust other people’s accounts, but now, I’m a full believer.\n\nSo… uhh… by for now!\n\nShoutout to Skibidi Shane!"
